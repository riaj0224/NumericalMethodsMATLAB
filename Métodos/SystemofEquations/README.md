# Gauss' Method for Solving Systems of Linear Equations

This repository includes MATLAB scripts that illustrate the application of Gauss' method for solving systems of linear equations.

## :scroll: Overview

Gauss' method, also known as Gaussian elimination, is a popular algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It operates by performing elementary row operations to reduce a system of linear equations to row echelon form and then back substitution to find the solutions.

The script in this repository provides a hands-on demonstration of how Gaussian elimination works, enabling users to understand the underlying mechanisms of the method.

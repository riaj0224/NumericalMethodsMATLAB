# Matrix Operations: Manual Computation in MATLAB

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts that perform a range of matrix operations without relying on MATLAB's built-in functions. 

## :scroll: Overview

These scripts provide an in-depth understanding of fundamental matrix operations and are perfect for anyone looking to dive deeper into the inner workings of these operations. Operations include:

1. **Matrix Addition**: Add two matrices element by element.
2. **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtract one matrix from another, element by element.
3. **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices according to the rules of matrix multiplication.
4. **Matrix Transpose**: Flip a matrix over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices for each element.
5. **Matrix Inversion**: Compute the inverse of a square matrix.

## :file_folder: Repository Contents

This repository contains the following MATLAB scripts:

1. `matrix_add.m`: MATLAB script for matrix addition.
2. `matrix_sub.m`: MATLAB script for matrix subtraction.
3. `matrix_mul.m`: MATLAB script for matrix multiplication.
4. `matrix_transpose.m`: MATLAB script for transposing a matrix.
5. `matrix_inverse.m`: MATLAB script for matrix inversion.

Each script implements the corresponding operation manually, without using MATLAB's built-in functions.

## :computer: Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer. Once you have MATLAB set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the scripts within the MATLAB environment.

# Numerical Methods: Closed Methods for Root Finding

This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts demonstrating the application of numerical methods for root finding. The primary focus lies on the closed methods, namely the Bisection method and Fixed-point iteration.

## :scroll: Overview

The aim of these scripts is to provide a practical understanding of how closed methods work and their application in finding the roots of functions. The two methods showcased here, Bisection and Fixed-point iteration, are fundamental tools in numerical analysis.

1. **Bisection Method**: This is a simple and robust method that guarantees convergence. It works by repeatedly bisecting an interval and then selecting a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing.

2. **Fixed-Point Iteration**: Also known as the method of successive approximations, this method finds a root by starting with an initial guess and then applying a function repeatedly until the value does not change (or changes insignificantly) within a specified error range.

## :file_folder: Repository Contents

This repository contains the following MATLAB scripts:

1. `bisection.m`: MATLAB script demonstrating the bisection method.
2. `fpoint.m`: MATLAB script demonstrating the fixed-point iteration method.

## :computer: Getting Started

To run these scripts, you need to have MATLAB installed on your system. Once you've installed MATLAB, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the scripts using the MATLAB environment.

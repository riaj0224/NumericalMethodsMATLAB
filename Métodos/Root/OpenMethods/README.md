# Numerical Methods: Open Methods for Root Finding

This repository houses a collection of MATLAB scripts that showcase the use of numerical methods for root finding. Emphasis is placed on open methods, particularly the Secant method and Newton-Raphson method.

## :scroll: Overview

These scripts aim to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of open methods in determining the roots of functions. The Secant method and Newton-Raphson method, featured here, are vital components of numerical analysis:

1. **Secant Method**: An iterative root-finding method that uses a sequence of roots of secant lines combined with linear interpolation to approximate the root of a function.

2. **Newton-Raphson Method**: A powerful and commonly used root-finding method that applies tangents to estimate the roots of a real-valued function.

## :file_folder: Repository Contents

This repository comprises the following MATLAB scripts:

1. `root_secant.m`: MATLAB script that illustrates the Secant method.
2. `root_newtonraphson.m`: MATLAB script that demonstrates the Newton-Raphson method.

## :computer: Getting Started

To execute these scripts, you need MATLAB installed on your machine. Once MATLAB is set up, you can clone this repository onto your local system and run the scripts using the MATLAB environment.

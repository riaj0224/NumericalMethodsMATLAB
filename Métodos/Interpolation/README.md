# Least Squares Methods: Regression Analysis in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that demonstrate various least squares methods for regression analysis, including linear, polynomial, exponential, and power regressions.

## :scroll: Overview

Least squares methods are fundamental tools in statistical modeling and data analysis, used to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems. In the context of regression analysis, these methods can be used to fit a function to data points in a way that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. 

The scripts included in this repository offer insights into different forms of regression, such as:

1. **Linear Regression**: Modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables in a manner that is linear in the parameters.
2. **Polynomial Regression**: Using a polynomial to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
3. **Exponential Regression**: Fitting an exponential function to data.
4. **Power Regression**: Fitting a power series to data.

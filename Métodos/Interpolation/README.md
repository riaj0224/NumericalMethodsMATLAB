# Interpolation Methods: In-depth Exploration in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB scripts demonstrating different interpolation methods including linear interpolation, Newton's polynomial interpolation, and Lagrange polynomial interpolation.

## :scroll: Overview

Interpolation is a crucial mathematical technique often used to estimate unknown values between two known values. This repository focuses on three main types of interpolation:

1. **Linear Interpolation**: Estimates a value between two known values using a straight line.
2. **Newton's Polynomial Interpolation**: Estimates unknown values using an (n-1) degree polynomial for n data points.
3. **Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation**: Estimates unknown values using the Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

## :file_folder: Repository Contents

This repository contains the following MATLAB scripts:

1. `linear_interpolation.m`: MATLAB script demonstrating linear interpolation.
2. `newton_interpolation.m`: MATLAB script demonstrating Newton's polynomial interpolation.
3. `lagrange_interpolation.m`: MATLAB script demonstrating Lagrange polynomial interpolation.

Each script implements the corresponding interpolation method in MATLAB.

## :computer: Getting Started

To run these scripts, you need MATLAB installed on your machine. After setting up MATLAB, you can clone this repository to your local system and run the scripts within the MATLAB environment.

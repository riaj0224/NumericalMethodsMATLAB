# Numerical Methods in MATLAB

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of MATLAB scripts, including individual numerical methods and a project using these methods to analyze the mechanical properties of materials from tension test data.

## :scroll: Overview

Numerical methods play an essential role in engineering and science. This repository includes a series of exercises that explore different numerical methods such as root finding methods, matrix operations, solution of systems of linear equations, least squares methods, and interpolation methods. Furthermore, these methods are applied in a project to analyze the mechanical properties of two materials from tension test data.

## :file_folder: Repository Contents

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing MATLAB scripts related to a specific topic:

1. `ClosedRootMethods`: Scripts for closed methods of root finding, such as bisection and fixed point.
2. `OpenRootMethods`: Scripts for open methods of root finding, such as the secant method and Newton-Raphson.
3. `MatrixOperations`: Scripts demonstrating matrix operations performed manually, without utilizing MATLAB's in-built functions.
4. `GaussMethod`: A script illustrating Gauss' method for solving systems of linear equations.
5. `LeastSquaresMethods`: Scripts demonstrating least squares methods, including linear, polynomial, exponential, and power regressions.
6. `InterpolationMethods`: Scripts for linear interpolation, Newton's polynomial interpolation, and Lagrange polynomial interpolation.
7. `PracticeExercises`: Additional exercises to further understand and practice the implementation of these numerical methods.
8. `Proyecto`: A project using the numerical methods to analyze the mechanical properties of materials based on tension test data.

## :computer: Getting Started

To run these scripts, MATLAB must be installed on your machine. Once you have set up MATLAB, clone this repository to your local machine and run the scripts using the MATLAB environment.
